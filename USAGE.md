  - **10+ turns**: Deep discussions, extended exploration

### Delay (1-30 seconds)
- **What it does**: Time to wait between responses before sending to the other AI
- **Recommendations**:
  - **1-2 seconds**: Fast-paced, but may miss responses
  - **3-5 seconds**: Standard, works for most cases
  - **10+ seconds**: For very long responses or slow connections

### Topic (Optional)
- **What it does**: Initial prompt sent to ChatGPT to start the debate
- **Tips**:

  - Can be left empty to manually start the conversation

## Advanced Usage

### Manual Start (No Topic)

If you leave the topic blank:

1. Start the debate in the extension
2. Manually type your first message in either ChatGPT or Gemini
3. Send it
4. The extension will detect the response and automatically send it to the other AI
5. The debate continues automatically from there

### Monitoring Progress

The **Activity Log** shows:
- 🚀 When debates start
- 📝 When each AI responds
- ➡️ When messages are sent to the other AI
- ✅ When debates complete
- 🛑 When debates are stopped
- ❌ Any errors that occur

### Stopping Early

Click "Stop Debate" at any time to:
- End the current debate
- Prevent further automatic messages
- Keep the conversation history intact
- Allow you to manually continue if desired

## Best Practices

### For Video Recording

1. **Use full-screen or maximized windows**
   - Cleaner look for recordings
   - Split-view works great with screen recording software

2. **Keep the extension popup visible**
   - Shows the activity log
   - Indicates debate status
   - Position near the recorded area if possible

3. **Choose good topics**
   - Interesting and engaging
   - Not too technical unless that's your audience
   - Clear starting point

4. **Adjust settings appropriately**
   - Longer delays give viewers time to read
   - More turns = longer videos
   - Test first before recording

### For Research/Testing

1. **Use varied topics**
   - Test different types of questions
   - Compare philosophical vs factual debates
   - Try open-ended vs specific questions

2. **Document your findings**
   - Save conversation transcripts
   - Note interesting patterns
   - Compare how different AIs approach topics

3. **Experiment with settings**
   - Try different turn limits
   - Test various delay times
   - See how topic phrasing affects responses

### For Entertainment

1. **Try fun topics**
   - Pop culture debates
   - Silly hypotheticals
   - Creative scenarios

2. **Let it run**
   - Sometimes the best moments come after a few turns
   - AIs can surprise you with creative responses

3. **Share with friends**
   - Show them interesting exchanges
   - Get topic suggestions
   - Discuss the results

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Messages Not Sending

**Symptoms**: Extension says it's sending, but messages don't appear

**Solutions**:
1. Refresh both AI pages
2. Ensure you're signed in to both services
3. Check that input boxes are visible and active
4. Try increasing the delay setting
5. Look for errors in the Activity Log

### Responses Not Detected

**Symptoms**: AI responds, but extension doesn't capture it

**Solutions**:
1. Wait longer - some responses take time
2. Check if the AI is still generating (look for stop/generating indicators)
3. The extension waits for responses to stabilize
4. Refresh the page and try again

### Debate Stops Unexpectedly

**Symptoms**: Debate ends before reaching turn limit

**Possible causes**:
1. One AI might have hit a rate limit
2. Network connection issues
3. Page was refreshed or navigated away
4. Browser tab was closed or crashed

**Solutions**:
1. Check the Activity Log for error messages
2. Ensure stable internet connection
3. Wait a few minutes if rate limited
4. Start a new debate

### Wrong AI Receiving Messages

**Symptoms**: Messages go to the wrong AI or both AIs

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure only one ChatGPT tab and one Gemini tab are open
2. Close extra tabs
3. Refresh and try again

## Tips & Tricks

### Getting Better Debates

1. **Frame questions as debates**: "Should X be allowed?" works better than "Tell me about X"
2. **Ask for arguments**: "Argue for/against..." encourages debate format
3. **Use controversial topics**: More interesting exchanges
4. **Request specific perspectives**: "Take the position that..."

### Saving Conversations

Chrome extensions can't save conversations directly, but you can:
1. Manually copy/paste exchanges into a document
2. Take screenshots of interesting moments
3. Use screen recording software for full debates
4. Use browser's print-to-PDF feature

### Extending Debates

If a debate ends but you want more:
1. Stop the current debate
2. Manually add a follow-up question in either AI
3. Start a new debate (it will continue from there)

### Comparing AI Personalities

Pay attention to how each AI:
- Structures arguments
- Uses language and tone
- Handles controversial topics
- Admits uncertainty
- Builds on previous points

## Examples of Good Debate Formats

### Structured Debate
```
"You are AI A. AI B will argue that climate change is primarily human-caused. 
You will argue the opposite position. Begin with your opening statement."
```

### Socratic Discussion
```
"Let's explore: What is intelligence? 
Please ask me questions to help clarify this concept."
```

### Creative Collaboration
```
"Let's write a story together. I'll start with a premise, 
you continue with the next sentence, and we'll alternate."
```

### Problem Solving
```
"How can we solve traffic congestion in major cities? 
Let's brainstorm solutions together, building on each other's ideas."
```

## Safety & Ethics

### Remember
- This tool automates web interactions
- Respect both platforms' Terms of Service
- Don't use for spam or abuse
- Be aware of rate limits
- Use responsibly

### Privacy
- No data is collected by the extension
- All conversations stay between you and the AI services
- Extension only runs on specified websites
