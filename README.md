## 🚀 Usage

### Setup

   - For ChatGPT vs ChatGPT: Open two ChatGPT tabs
   - For Gemini vs Gemini: Open two Gemini tabs
   - Sign in to all tabs if needed

2. **Arrange Windows**
   - Use Chrome's split-view or arrange windows side by side
   - This allows you to watch both AIs simultaneously

### Starting a Debate

1. **Click the extension icon** in your toolbar

2. **Configure settings**:
   - **AI Participant 1**: Select ChatGPT or Gemini for the first participant
   - **AI Participant 2**: Select ChatGPT or Gemini for the second participant
   - **Topic**: Enter a debate topic or question (e.g., "What is the meaning of life?")
   - **Turn Limit**: Set how many exchanges you want (default: 5)
   - **Delay**: Set seconds between responses (default: 3)

3. **Click "Start Debate"**
   - If you provided a topic, it will be sent to Participant 1 first
   - If no topic, manually start the conversation in either AI
   - The extension will then automatically exchange responses

4. **Watch the debate unfold**
   - Monitor the activity log for progress
   - Both AI pages will show a "🤖 AI Debate Active" indicator

5. **Stop anytime**
   - Click "Stop Debate" to end early
   - Or wait for the turn limit to be reached

## 🎥 Tips for Recording

- Use a clean browser profile without other extensions for minimal UI
- The extension has a simple, unobtrusive design
- Activity log helps you track what's happening off-screen
- Consider using split-screen recording software to capture both AIs

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Extension Structure

```
Debate-AI-Extension-Chorme/
├── manifest.json           # Extension configuration
├── popup.html             # Control panel UI
├── popup.css              # Styling
├── popup.js               # Control panel logic
├── background.js          # Service worker for coordination
├── content-chatgpt.js     # ChatGPT page interaction
├── content-gemini.js      # Gemini page interaction
└── icons/                 # Extension icons
```

### How It Works

1. **Content Scripts** inject into ChatGPT and Gemini pages
2. **Background Service Worker** coordinates the debate flow
3. **Popup UI** provides user control and status updates
4. Content scripts:
   - Extract AI responses from the page
   - Inject messages into input fields
   - Click send buttons programmatically
   - Wait for response completion before continuing

### Permissions

- `activeTab`: To interact with the current tab
- `storage`: To save user preferences
- `scripting`: To inject content scripts
- Host permissions for `chat.openai.com`, `chatgpt.com`, and `gemini.google.com`

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Requires active sessions in the AI tabs you select
- For same-AI debates (ChatGPT vs ChatGPT or Gemini vs Gemini), you need two separate tabs open
- May need adjustment if OpenAI or Google change their UI
- Response detection uses heuristics and may occasionally miss responses
- Rate limits from AI providers still apply
- Does not bypass any API limits or terms of service

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Extension not working?**
- Ensure you're signed into the required AI tabs
- For same-AI debates, make sure you have two separate tabs open
- Refresh the AI pages after installing the extension
- Check the browser console for error messages
- Verify the extension has necessary permissions

**Messages not sending?**
- Try increasing the delay setting
- Check if the AI pages are fully loaded
- Refresh the pages and try again

**Responses not detected?**
- The extension waits for responses to stabilize
- Very long responses may take time to complete
- Check the activity log for status updates
